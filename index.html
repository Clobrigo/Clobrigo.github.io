<p>Hello everyone my name is Carl Lobrigo and I am a freshman at GCU. My major is Cyber Security and I chose this as my major because I have always been interested in computer's and knew that I wanted to do something in that field. I attended Paradise Honors Highschool where I stayed all 4 years. I also used to play basketball but have slowed down since highschool.</p>
<p>It's April 24th, 2022 and I am a student at GCU </p>
